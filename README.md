# React JS Developer Recruitment Test

Welcome to our React-focused frontend developer assessment! This test evaluates your React proficiency, problem-solving skills, and UI/UX sensibilities through practical implementation and code improvements.

## Project Overview

This React project contains intentional issues and UI limitations. Your task is to:

1. Identify and fix implementation errors
2. Enhance the user experience
3. Improve code quality
4. Add essential features

**Key Technologies**:
